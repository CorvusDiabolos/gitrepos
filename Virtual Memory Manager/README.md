# Virtual Memory Manager [C]

This program simulates the Virtual Memory Manager of a computer's Operating System, written entirely in C.

This program was selected as it demonstrates my understanding of the relationship between the various levels in a computer system and demonstrate how computer hardware executes a program.  It is also beneficial at demonstrating my ability to program in more than one programming language as I first learned to work with Java before stepping into C.  The assignment was challenging and not without a minor flaw (see below), which demonstrates my ability to problem solve while programming.

*TODO: only issue is that does an unnecessary linear search of the page table. If there is no page fault, the frame associated with a page can be found at page_table[page-number]*
