# What's the Dealio Chat Application & Server

Client and Server both written in Python 3; client uses tkinter GUI implementation (i.e. #sudo apt install python3-tk)

These two programs were selected to demonstrate code with the ability to interact with a network, selecting appropriate data structures to solve a problem (in this case JSON, arrays, and maps), and programming paradigms via multi-threading.  The program began in Java, but moved to Python 3 as the language better supported many parameters of the protocol needed within the chat application and server.

**Usage**
* Mac/Linux: python3 <filename>.py
* PC: python <filename>.py or by opening file via Python *(note Windows 10 WSL users may need to follow SSH steps to run tkinter)*

**NOTE**
This is only a partial implementation of the WTDP.  May not work with other servers/clients until complete.  Currently assumes well-behaved clients.
