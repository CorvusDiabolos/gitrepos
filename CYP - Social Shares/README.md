# Founding Fathers’ Choose Your Politics

This Python script is part of a larger group project *(https://github.com/knilssen/Founding_Fathers)*.  Its purpose is to check a given URL to parse social media data about said URL (i.e. Facebook likes, reddit upvotes, etc.).  That data was compared against a word analyzer to give weight to political news stories on a website.

This program was selected to demonstrate my ability to work in a larger group setting and not just the standard individual or pair dynamic of the classroom.  It is also beneficial at demonstrating my ability to program in more than one programming language as I began working on this piece of the project in JavaScript before deciding to restart with Python to better integrate with other pieces of the project.  I hadn’t worked with Python or JSON prior to this project and had to quickly learn both.  This also demonstrates my ability to write code that can communicate with a network.
