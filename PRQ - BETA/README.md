# Pathology Report Query - BETA

## Westminster College Senior Capstone Project

A C# application developed in Visual Studio for ARUP Laboratories.
Performs SQL queries on pathology reports stored in a local database.

This project was a fantastic learning experience with the end product being met with high praise.  Many labs are very excited to use it, claiming it will save them countless man hours.  It has made a great addition to my portfolio and demonstrates various learning goals of the Westminster College Computer Science Learning Goals.  The app demonstrates my ability to write programs that can communicate with a network by connecting to the company database.  This was my first time ysing C#, which demonstrates my ability to learn new programming languages to design, test, and write object oriented programs.  Best of all, it demonstrated a user-first design to build an application that would be accessible and natural for its intended user base.

**NOTE:** application will launch, but does not fully function on a non-ARUP PC.
Much code and notation has been deleted or obfuscated to protect anything that may potentially compromise
patient data or proprietary company information.
