# Pathology Report Query - BETA

## Westminster College Senior Capstone Project

A C# application developed in Visual Studio for ARUP Laboratories.
Performs SQL queries on pathology reports stored in a local database.

**NOTE:** application will launch, but does not fully function on a non-ARUP PC.
Much code and notation has been deleted or obfuscated to protect anything that may potentially compromise
patient data or proprietary company information.
