![Pi, Legos, and a broken NES](https://github.com/CorvusDiabolos/gitrepos/blob/master/PiTendo/Photos/WP_20170605_21_29_05_Rich_LI.jpg)

This project was completed in an electronics workshop elective class to build a retro video game emulation device.  A Raspberry Pi 3 was loaded with the RetroPie software and then mounted inside a broken Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) then wired to the power button.  More specific details may be located in the included PowerPoint presentation.

The project was selected to demonstrate knowledge of working with direct hardware/software communication.  It required learning how to operate in a custom version of Linux and operate within a network (first major usage of SSH).  Not every problem or desire had an easy solution, many of which required custom Python scripts to be written in Nano.  Project required heavy tinkering to execute, which is thankfully allowed with the RetroPie software.

**Fun accomplishments:**
* Boot up sequence video
* Main menu background music
* Custom theme
* Higher quality game art and descriptions
* Support for Xbox and PlayStation controllers
* Many games across various retro systems
* Runs Kodi
* Runs Doom
* Runs Warcraft 2

*Note: backup image of the project is too large to load onto github.  A copy can be downloaded for mounting to a Raspberry Pi from my personal cloud storage [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlVF6l7lg_Wmnfo-NlpFJLl3AulXtA).
